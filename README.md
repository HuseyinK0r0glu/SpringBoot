SpringBoot Project
Project Overview
This project is built using Spring Boot, a popular Java framework for creating web applications and REST APIs. The project aims to demonstrate how to build a backend service with features like dependency injection, RESTful APIs, and database interaction.

Features
RESTful API endpoints
Basic CRUD operations
Use of Spring Boot annotations (@RestController, @Autowired, etc.)
Connection to a relational database using Spring Data JPA
Exception handling and validation
Technologies Used
Java 11: Programming language.
Spring Boot: Framework for building the application.
Spring Data JPA: For interacting with the database.
H2 Database/MySQL/PostgreSQL: Depending on configuration, you can set up an in-memory database or use a relational database.
Maven: For dependency management.

API Usage
Once the application is running, you can interact with it using tools like Postman or cURL. Some example endpoints could be:

GET /api/entities: Fetch all entities
POST /api/entity: Create a new entity
PUT /api/entity/{id}: Update an entity by ID
DELETE /api/entity/{id}: Delete an entity by ID
Database Configuration
The application uses H2 Database by default, but you can configure it to use MySQL or PostgreSQL by updating the application.properties file with the correct database connection details.
