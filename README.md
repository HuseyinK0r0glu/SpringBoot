# Spring Boot Project

## Project Overview
This project is built using *Spring Boot*, a popular Java framework for creating web applications and REST APIs. The goal is to showcase how to develop a backend service with key features such as dependency injection, RESTful APIs, and database interaction.

## Features
- *RESTful API Endpoints*: Easily interact with the application through HTTP requests.
- *Basic CRUD Operations*: Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionality.
- *Spring Boot Annotations*: Utilizes annotations like @RestController, @Autowired for simplified coding.
- *Database Integration: Connects to a relational database using **Spring Data JPA*.
- *Exception Handling & Validation*: Ensures robust handling of application errors and input validation.

## Technologies Used
- *Java 11*: Main programming language.
- *Spring Boot*: Primary framework for building the application.
- *Spring Data JPA*: For seamless interaction with the database.
- *H2 Database / MySQL / PostgreSQL*: In-memory or relational database, depending on your configuration.
- *Maven*: Dependency management tool.

## API Usage
Once the application is up and running, you can interact with it using tools like *Postman* or *cURL*. Example endpoints include:

- GET /api/entities – Fetch all entities.
- POST /api/entity – Create a new entity.
- PUT /api/entity/{id} – Update an existing entity by its ID.
- DELETE /api/entity/{id} – Delete an entity by its ID.

## Database Configuration
The default database used is *H2* (in-memory), but the project can be configured to use *MySQL* or *PostgreSQL*. To change the database, update the application.properties file with the necessary connection details, such as:

```properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your_database
spring.datasource.username=your_username
spring.datasource.password=your_password
